# Customer and Product Sales Analysis

## Description 

In this project, I acted as a Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst for GlobalElec, a leading global electronics retailer. My goal was to analyze and visualize the company's sales data across various dimensions, including customers, products, stores, and international exchange rates. I used data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques to uncover key insights about market trends, customer behaviors, and regional differences in sales performance.

By preparing the data, conducting detailed descriptive statistics, and creating insightful visualizations, I was able to transform raw data into actionable insights that helped shape the future strategies of GlobalElec. Through this project, I showcased my ability to tackle complex data challenges and present findings in a clear, impactful manner.

## Datasets Used

For this project, I utilized five key datasets to analyze and visualize GlobalElec's sales performance:

1. **[customers.csv](https://github.com/DmitriiZag/ElectricSupplier/blob/master/data/Customers.csv):**
This dataset contains demographic and transactional information about the company's customers. It includes details such as customer IDs, locations, purchase history, and customer type. This data helped me analyze customer behavior and identify trends based on various demographics.
exchange_rates.csv
2. **[The exchange_rates.csv](https://github.com/DmitriiZag/ElectricSupplier/blob/master/data/Exchange_Rates.csv):** dataset provides historical exchange rates for different currencies, allowing me to account for currency fluctuations in sales data. This was particularly useful in analyzing how exchange rates impacted international sales and comparing product prices across regions.
3. **[products.csv](https://github.com/DmitriiZag/ElectricSupplier/blob/master/data/Products.csv):**
This file contains information about the company's product offerings, including product IDs, categories, prices, and brands. By analyzing this data, I was able to identify which product categories performed best, understand the range of products offered, and assess pricing strategies.
4. **[sales.csv](https://github.com/DmitriiZag/ElectricSupplier/blob/master/data/Sales.csv):**
The sales.csv dataset includes transactional data, such as sales transactions, product IDs, quantities sold, and sale dates. This data was central to my analysis, as it allowed me to calculate overall sales performance, identify trends in sales over time, and assess the popularity of different products and regions.
5. **[stores.csv](https://github.com/DmitriiZag/ElectricSupplier/blob/master/data/Stores.csv):**
This dataset contains information about the companyâ€™s store locations, including store IDs, countries, cities, and sales performance by store. By analyzing this data, I was able to uncover regional performance patterns and identify the top-performing stores in different markets.

## My Approach

I worked through three main stages to complete this project:

1. **Data Preparation** ([data_preparation.ipynb](https://github.com/DmitriiZag/ElectricSupplier/blob/master/data_preparation.ipynb)): I began by working with five core datasets: customers.csv, exchange_rates.csv, products.csv, sales.csv, and stores.csv. During this phase, I cleaned and transformed the raw data, ensuring that it was properly structured and ready for analysis. This step involved handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and combining data from multiple sources into a unified dataset.
2. **Descriptive Statistics** ([descriptive_statistics.ipynb](https://github.com/DmitriiZag/ElectricSupplier/blob/master/descriptive_statistics.ipynb)): After preparing the data, I performed a series of descriptive statistical analyses to uncover trends and patterns. I explored key metrics such as sales distribution, customer demographics, and product categories to identify significant trends in the data, including the dominance of certain products and customer behaviors.
3. **Data Visualization** ([data_visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/DmitriiZag/ElectricSupplier/blob/master/data_visualization.ipynb)): With the cleaned and analyzed data, I then created a series of visualizations to showcase key insights. I used various charts and dashboards to highlight important findings, such as the rise of online sales, regional market leaders, and the popularity of different product categories. These visualizations helped transform raw data into actionable insights that could inform business decisions at GlobalElec.
